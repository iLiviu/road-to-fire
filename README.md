# Road To FIRE
Road To FIRE is a portfolio manager app for your stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies, commodities, P2P loans and real estate. It runs in your browser, so you don't need to install anything. Privacy is important, so all data is stored in your local browser (or your cloud storage account, if you provide one in order to sync data across your devices). The only data sent to the app server are the symbols for your assets, in order to get their current quotes.

## Key Features:
* Manage your stock, ETF, mutual funds, bonds, cryptocurrencies, commodities, P2P loans and real estate portfolio in one app. 
* Automatically get quotes for stocks, mutual funds, bonds, commodities and cryptocurrencies.

* Steps required to rebalance your portfolio to reach desired allocation.
* Multiple currencies supported, and the value is converted to your base currency using latest forex quotes.
* Track unrealized profit-loss.
* Capital gains statements.
* Automatic interest calculation and payment.

* Support for recurring transactions that can execute automatically or only after user approval.

* Sync across multiple devices using a cloud storage account (Dropbox, Google Drive and RemoteStorage account are supported).
* Privacy focused. All data is stored in your browser local storage or your own cloud storage account.
